"""SkillForgeRouter data types — :class:`RouterHit` + :class:`SkillSource` Protocol.

Two design points worth highlighting:

- :class:`RouterHit` is **self-contained**. Unlike the legacy
  ``ScoredSkill`` in :mod:`pico.memory_engine.skill_local.types` (which
  only carried name + score and forced consumers to re-fetch the body
  from SkillRegistry), :class:`RouterHit` ships the rendered ``content``
  so :class:`ContextBuilder` can write it straight into the prompt
  without a second round-trip to the source.

- :class:`SkillSource` is internal rather than a plugin contribution point.
  ``@runtime_checkable`` lets tests assert duck-typed conformance
  without inheritance; the cost is accepting any object whose surface
  matches, which is fine because the registration set is closed.

The legacy ``ScoredSkill`` in ``skill/types.py`` stays untouched for
now — :class:`LocalPool` and :class:`SkillService` continue to use it.
The cleanup PR collapses the two once SkillService is removed.
