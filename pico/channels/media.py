"""Shared media persistence for channel adapters.

An adapter fetches bytes from its own SDK, then hands them here to write.
Centralizing the write gives every channel the same two guarantees:

- **No path traversal** — directory components in a server-supplied name are
  stripped, so a crafted ``../../x`` can't escape the media directory.
- **No silent collisions** — the saved name is prefixed with a content hash,
  so two senders' ``report.pdf`` don't clobber each other while re-sending
  identical bytes stays idempotent.

Adapters call this helper after fetching bytes through their own SDK.
