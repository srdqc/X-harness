"""Import litellm with its import-time terminal noise silenced.

litellm prints a "Provider List" banner (gated by ``suppress_debug_info``) and,
because it installs its own stderr ``StreamHandler`` on its ``LiteLLM*`` loggers,
emits DEBUG to the terminal *while importing*. Raise those loggers' levels across
the import so that DEBUG never reaches the terminal, then restore them.

Stripping the handlers for the rest of the session stays with Pico's
``_strip_tty_stream_handlers`` (it runs after this deferred import in the TUI
path); doing it here too would mutate global logging state as a side effect of
merely importing a provider module.
