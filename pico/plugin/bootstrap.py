"""One-call plugin bootstrap helper.

Glues :class:`PluginDiscovery` and :class:`PluginRegistry` so callers
(CLI / AgentLoop construction) don't repeat the two-step dance.

Kept as a free function rather than a class so the dataflow stays
obviously linear: discover → activate → return. Callers wanting more
control instantiate the two pieces directly.
