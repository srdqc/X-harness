"""Cross-platform advisory file lock.

Serializes cross-process (and cross-thread) writers to a shared file by
taking an exclusive lock on a sibling ``.lock`` anchor via ``portalocker``
(POSIX ``fcntl.flock`` + Windows ``LockFileEx`` under the hood).

Replaces the previous ``fcntl``-only lock paths that silently degraded to
*unlocked* on Windows (``import fcntl`` → ``ImportError`` / ``sys.platform ==
"win32"`` no-op branches), which lost concurrent writes on Windows.
