"""Per-trial activation ledger + beacon.

Every runtime activation event (hook fire, skill injection mirror, code
beacon, presence assert) appends one JSON line to
``<workspace>/activation_ledger.jsonl``. Writes are best-effort: a ledger
failure must never affect the trial.

``activation_beacon`` is the mandatory one-liner inside every evolved
code path (design section 3, code class). It resolves the workspace from
``PICO_ACTIVATION_WORKSPACE`` and silently no-ops when unset, so
product runtime never pays for it.
