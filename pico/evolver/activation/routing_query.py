"""dry_query — offline probe of the real skill discovery + selection path.

Round-4 forensics found that a custom skill authored on disk under
``skill_library/tb2_gap_fill/`` was never injected: the benchmark agent
constructs ``SkillForgeConfig(enabled=False)`` with empty ``local_dirs``, so
the directory is never mounted as a discovery layer and ``select()`` returns
``[]`` before any retrieval runs. ``dry_query`` answers, without an LLM or the
SR server, "which skill names would routing inject for this task?" by building
a real :class:`LocalSkillCatalog` + :class:`SkillForgeRouter` whose
``local_dirs`` point at ``library_root`` and running the actual BM25 retrieval
+ resolve path.

No LLM is involved: the LLM gate and query rewriter are disabled, so selection
reduces to filesystem discovery + lexical (BM25) scoring — the deterministic
core of the real path that the benchmark must wire up.

    Args:
        task_text: The task description fed to skill selection.
        library_root: Root dir mounted as an extra discovery layer (the
            recursive ``SKILL.md`` scan walks its subtree, so
            ``.../skill_library`` surfaces ``tb2_gap_fill/<skill>/SKILL.md``).

    Returns:
        Flat list of skill names (``SkillMeta.name``) routing would inject,
        in injection order. This mirrors the benchmark's two injection
        surfaces (ContextBuilder.build_system_prompt): the ``always: true``
        skills rendered under "Active Skills", followed by the retrieval
        ``select()`` hits, deduped by name.
