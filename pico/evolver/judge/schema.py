"""Schema definitions for LLM judge output.

The judge reads a trajectory and produces a structured analysis with two
orthogonal axes:

- **Issue type** (L1 / L2 / L3, per spec §3) — routes the output:
  L1 → human review; L2/L3 → evolver patch.
- **Patch location & purpose** ((WHERE, WHY), per spec §12.4-§12.5) — only
  populated for L2 / L3, identifies what to edit and which pathology
  is being addressed.

All enums are ``str`` subclasses so they JSON-serialize to their string
values without custom encoders, and so they compare cleanly against
strings parsed from LLM output (``IssueType.L1 == "L1"``).

PatchWhy.other accepts a free-form sub-name (``"other:<new_category>"``)
to support the evolving WHY taxonomy described in spec §12.5: judge may
propose a new pathology class, which gets routed for human review before
becoming a first-class enum.
