"""The bench plugin contract: what a benchmark implements to become runnable.

A bench module exposes ``build(ctx: LaunchContext) -> BenchBundle``. The
bundle is pure wiring — nothing expensive happens until the runner calls the
closures, so ``status`` can build a bundle just to count artifacts.

What a new bench must bring: scorer subprocess + result files with an infra marker, a result->TaskEval
reader, per-attempt trajectory files, a train/test split, and an editable-path
whitelist for its subject repo. Everything else (funnel, gates, sealed test,
resume) is the shared loop.
