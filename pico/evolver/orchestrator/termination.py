"""Loop termination — the "never stop early" discipline, as code not prompt.

The SOP stops on the first of these conditions, and the exhaustion signal is
always measured against VANILLA (the fixed cold-start baseline) on train, never
against the previous parent and never against the sealed test set:

- ``patience`` consecutive rounds in which no candidate beat vanilla on train
  (exploration exhausted — the primary signal), or
- ``max_rounds`` reached (a hard cap backstop), or
- ``max_consecutive_errors`` rounds in a row that produced no real decision
  (failed or inconclusive evidence). A no-decision round is NOT evidence about
  exploration, so it must not burn patience — but an endless outage must not
  loop either, so it gets its own counter and an honest ``errors_exhausted``
  stop reason.

``record_round(promoted=...)`` takes the vanilla-comparison signal: True iff at
least one candidate's full-train confirm beat vanilla this round (regardless of
whether it also beat its ratcheted parent baseline and banked). Keeping this in
a small, unit-tested tracker is exactly what lets a weak driver model run the
loop: the stop decision is the harness's, not something the model has to
remember to check.
