"""Focused-subset statistics for the two-stage Fisher gate (SOP §2 ⑤/⑥).

Ported from the AppWorld evolution driver so the two-stage gate is in-package
and unit-testable. The stage-1 test asks a sharp, cheap question on a candidate's
WHY subset: *is the candidate's pass-rate significantly above the baseline's on
exactly the tasks the pathology occurs?* A one-sided Fisher exact on the 2x2
trial table answers it without a full-train run.

Denominator discipline (SOP §0 hard rule): infra-contaminated trials are NOT
dropped from the denominator. Recoverable infra is salvaged upstream by the ≤2
rerun ladder (:func:`pico.evolver.orchestrator.scoring.eval_with_infra_rerun`);
only genuinely persistent infra reaches here and counts as a non-pass (fail),
kept in the denominator. Dropping infra tasks would shrink the denominator and
overestimate pass@1 (the fair-subset extrapolation trap).
