"""Semantic-node contract — the one place the driver model is trusted, bounded.

A weak driver (Qwen / Kimi) follows instructions loosely and gives up early, so
every semantic step is reduced to a single call whose output must parse into a
fixed schema. When it doesn't, the node feeds the parse error back and retries a
bounded number of times before giving up — the same "retry, fix this" loop the
judge parser docstring anticipates, made explicit and reusable.

This is deliberately transport-agnostic: ``call_fn`` takes chat messages and
returns the assistant text. In production it wraps a
``pico.evolver.judge.llm_client`` backend (which already routes self-hosted
Qwen, Claude, and OpenRouter); in tests it is a plain function returning scripted
strings. ``parse_fn`` turns raw text into the target schema object and raises on
any defect; ``SemanticNode`` catches that, appends a repair turn, and retries.

The node is synchronous to match the orchestrator FSM. An async backend is
adapted by the caller (``asyncio.run`` in the production ``call_fn``); keeping the
retry logic sync avoids threading an event loop through the whole loop.
