"""Step ② — select WHY + design candidates (semantic, budgeted).

Two halves, matching the SOP: a *deterministic* WHY selection off the failure
map (pick 1-2 pathologies worth attacking this round), then a *semantic* design
call per candidate that writes an env-gated ``AppliedPatch`` (2-3 per WHY,
across levers). The budget (``max_why_per_round`` x ``candidates_per_why``) is
enforced in code so a chatty driver can't blow up the round's candidate count.

The design call's output is parsed straight through ``AppliedPatch.from_dict``,
so the dataclass's own invariants (non-empty components, unique component ids,
``patch_why=other`` needs ``patch_why_extra``, resolvable ``depends_on``) do the
schema validation; any violation raises and :class:`SemanticNode` feeds it back
for a bounded repair-retry.

Writing a *useful* diff needs the target file's current contents; the caller
supplies them via ``file_context`` (empty here keeps the node structural — it
still produces a schema-valid patch, but a production run wires repo context in).
The patch must be env-gated and default-off so the vanilla build stays
byte-identical when the activation flag is unset (SOP §2 ②).
