"""``confirm.respond`` RPC handler — confirm round-trip answer sink.

The frontend answers a ``confirm.request`` by calling
``confirm.respond {request_id, answer}``; this handler resolves the matching
pending future on the broker.

Registered via a closure that pre-binds the broker (mirrors
``register_turn_methods`` binding the ``emitter``). Gated on a non-None broker
by the umbrella, so the demo / test paths that build no broker do not register
it — keeping the umbrella-vs-production drift test balanced.

The method is part of the OpenRPC contract.
