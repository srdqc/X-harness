"""Managed settings — placeholder for company-deployment config locks.

``ManagedSettings`` is a thin dataclass describing
which config fields are locked by operator policy. It's currently
unconsumed — config loading doesn't yet consult it — but defining
the shape now means future work has a stable seam.

Typical use case (post-MVP): a managed Pico deployment locks
``providers.openrouter.api_key`` to the company's shared key and
``sandbox.backend`` to ``"boxlite"``. The loader checks
``ManagedSettings.locked_fields`` and rejects user-side overrides
of any field in that set.
